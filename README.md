# ACompositor

Auto Song Compositor Based On Diatonic Chord

## Motivation

Producing a song requires a large amount of time. 
Compositors make many attempts trying to organize notes which should sound good to listeners by using harmonical theories.
In this condition, attempts can be automated by code and existing time cost will be reduced.
ACompositor gets user's setting, something like jengre and song mood, and generates songs.
